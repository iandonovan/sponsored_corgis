# Sponsored Corgis [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/iandonovan/sponsored_corgis/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/iandonovan/sponsored_corgis)

Sponsored Corgis is a Google Chrome extension that replaces Facebook "Sponsored Story" content with pictures of adorable corgis. Since this is the first Chrome extension I've built, I used a whole bunch of resources along the way. Here are the highlights:

1. Hartley Brody's [BuzzKill](https://github.com/hartleybrody/buzzkill) project and its accompanying [blog post.](http://blog.hartleybrody.com/chrome-extension/)
2. Chrome's [Getting Started Guide.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html)
3. [Stack Overflow.](http://www.stackoverflow.com)

## Version 1.2 Changes

1. An improved Settings page to switch between Corgi and Custom Mode. Just click on the corgi icon to the right of the address bar.
2. Custom images! Right-click on any image, go to the Sponsored Corgis menu, and select "Save image." When you shift to Custom Mode in Settings, your images will be used instead of the corgis to replace ads.
3. If you don't like one of your custom images, just right-click it again and select "Delete image" from the Sponsored Corgis menu.
4. I moved the number of corgi pictures grabbed from Flickr from 400 to 300. This should get rid of the non-corgi pictures, and you can always use the new custom images!
