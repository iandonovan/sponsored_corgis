# Sponsored Corgis

Sponsored Corgis is a Google Chrome extension that replaces Facebook "Sponsored Story" content with pictures of adorable corgis. Since this is the first Chrome extension I've built, I used a whole bunch of resources along the way. Here are the highlights:

1. Hartley Brody's [BuzzKill](https://github.com/hartleybrody/buzzkill) project and its accompanying [blog post.](http://blog.hartleybrody.com/chrome-extension/)
2. Chrome's [Getting Started Guide.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html)
3. [Stack Overflow.](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
